# Outputs

This directory is reserved for derived outputs generated by the analysis pipeline
(e.g., relevance screening results, stance classifications, and summary tables).

To ensure reproducibility while avoiding the distribution of large or API-dependent
files, no outputs are version-controlled in this repository.

All outputs are generated locally by running the scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
